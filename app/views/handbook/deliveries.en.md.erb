# Deliveries

[Deliveries](/deliveries) are a central element of CSA Admin and allow you to manage all the delivery dates of your baskets throughout the year. Deliveries are one of the first elements to create. It's important that **all delivery dates** are defined **before the start of your fiscal year** because the creation of memberships and their baskets depends on it.

The next delivery as well as its number of baskets/complements per depot are always available from [the dashboard](/dashboard). Each delivery page also contains this information as well as the list of absent members.

> You can easily create batch deliveries using the "Multiple dates" tab in [the delivery creation form](/deliveries/new).

## Delivery cycles

Some organizations offer different delivery choices, for example:

- deliveries on Mondays or Thursdays.
- deliveries every week or every other week.
- deliveries only in winter or summer.

[Delivery cycles](/delivery_cycles) allow you to dynamically group existing deliveries from the same fiscal year according to your needs and thus offer you great flexibility in managing your deliveries. Each membership is associated with a delivery cycle, which determines its delivery dates and the number of baskets.

### Settings {#settings}

Settings define the initial selection of deliveries for this cycle. These filters are applied first:

- **Days**: Select which days of the week are included (e.g., Mondays only).
- **From week / Until week**: Limit deliveries to a specific range of week numbers. Useful for seasonal cycles (e.g., week 18 to week 42 for a summer season). When both boundaries are set, an **"Exclude week range"** option becomes available to invert the logic—excluding deliveries inside the range instead of outside (e.g., to skip a holiday period).
- **Week numbers**: Filter by even or odd week numbers.

### Periods {#periods}

Periods then apply additional filtering to the deliveries selected by the settings above. They divide the fiscal year into segments, each with its own rules. This two-step approach (settings → periods) gives you fine-grained control over which deliveries are included.

Each delivery cycle must have at least one period. Periods cannot overlap within the same cycle.

Each period has the following options:

- **From month / To month**: Define the fiscal year month range this period applies to (e.g., January to June for a first semester).
- **Delivery selection**: Within the period's month range, determines which deliveries are kept (e.g., all, every other, first of each month, etc.).
- **Minimum gap (in days)**: Set a minimum number of days between two deliveries within this period (e.g., 13 for a delivery every 2 weeks).

This allows for flexible configurations, such as weekly deliveries during summer months and bi-weekly deliveries during winter, all within the same delivery cycle.

### Depot availability

The availability of each delivery cycle can be configured by depot; for example, one depot may only offer Monday deliveries, another only Thursdays, while a last one will let members choose during registration.

The choice of a delivery cycle on the registration form depends on the configuration of their availability by depot. In any case, the choice of delivery cycle is offered to members only if at least two delivery cycles are available for a visible depot.

> When creating a membership by an admin, it's always possible to choose any delivery cycle. Baskets will be automatically created based on the deliveries of this cycle between the start and end dates ✨.

### Billing

Each delivery cycle can have its own billing options:

- **Price (per delivery)**: An additional fee for the management and/or delivery with this cycle.
- **Name (invoice)**: A custom name displayed on invoices instead of the default delivery cycle name.
- **Absences included annually**: Automatically exclude a certain number of deliveries, enabling members to plan a limited number of non-billed absences. See [Included Absences](/handbook/absences#absence-included) for more details.

## Basket complements

[Basket complements](/basket_complements) often follow their own delivery cycle in a way that is difficult to program dynamically. It is therefore necessary, and this for each basket complement, to define all the delivery dates where this complement is available or not. This operation must be carried out each year after the creation of new deliveries.
