# Newsletters

In addition to [automatic emails](/mail_templates) sent during specific events (new invoice, renewal, ...), CSA Admin also offers the possibility to send [newsletters (group emails)](/newsletters).

These newsletters can be addressed to all your members or to a specific audience (status, basket size, depot, ...).

> Unlike [automatic emails](/mail_templates), newsletters include an unsubscribe link (mandatory) in their footer.

## Templates

To facilitate the creation of your newsletters, CSA Admin offers a sophisticated system of [templates](/newsletter_templates). These templates are email models with predefined content blocks that you can create and modify according to your needs.

By default, [2 templates](/newsletter_templates) are available:

- <strong>Free text</strong>: a simple template with a single content block without a title.
- <strong>Next delivery</strong>: a more complex template with multiple content blocks, as well as dynamic information (basket content, next activity, ...).

Feel free to duplicate and modify them as you wish or [create new ones](/newsletter_templates/new).

> Despite the "group" sending of a newsletter, the content of each email is generated individually based on the information of each member (name, language, membership, ...).

### Content Blocks

Each template must contain at least one content block. This is a free text block that can be modified when creating a newsletter. A block whose content is left empty during newsletter editing will simply be ignored.

Each block is defined with a unique identifier (`id`) and optionally a title (`title`) as well as default content.

Example of a block with a title and default content:

~~~ liquid
{% content id: "identifier", title: "An optional title" %}
<p>Optional default content</p>
{% endcontent %}
~~~

## Attachments

You can add attachments to your newsletters, but the total weight of these attachments should not exceed 5 MB.

If you wish to send heavier attachments, you can use an external service such as [SwissTransfer](https://www.swisstransfer.com) or host them on your website and simply add a link to these files in your newsletter.

## Scheduling

To schedule the automatic sending of a newsletter, specify a future date in the "Delivery scheduled on" field. The system will automatically send it during the night of the chosen date. Make sure that the content is finalized before scheduling a send!

## Unsubscription

All members are subscribed to newsletters by default. Each member can unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the mandatory unsubscribe link present in the footer of each newsletter.

## Resubscription {#subscribe}

Members who have unsubscribed can easily subscribe again from [their account](<%= members_newsletter_deliveries_url(subdomain: Current.org.members_subdomain) %>) in the "Newsletters" section.

> Please note that the newsletter resubscription link only appears in the member's account if they have logged in themselves, and not when an admin has logged into their account on their behalf.
