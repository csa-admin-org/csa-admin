# Members

A member represents a person, family, shared accommodation, or company, and allows you to manage their information (address, contact details, etc.). A member's membership is managed via their subscriptions, with only one subscription per fiscal year.

A member is created through the [registration form](<%= new_members_member_url(subdomain: Current.org.members_subdomain) %>) or by an admin through the [member creation form](/members/new).

## Statuses

### To validate

New members created using the [registration form](<%= new_members_member_url(subdomain: Current.org.members_subdomain) %>) are added to [the list of members to validate](/members?scope=pending). They must be validated by an administrator to ensure that all information is correct.

It is possible to automatically send a welcome email when validating a member by configuring [the "Member validated" email template](/mail_templates/member_validated).

> Administrators can be notified by email when a new registration occurs by managing their [notification preferences](<%= edit_admin_path(current_admin) %>).

### Waiting list

Once validated, or directly created by an admin, a member with a (pending) subscription configuration ends up on the waiting list. The waiting list is useful for organizations that have a capacity limit on active members.

To make a member active, simply create a subscription for them (click "Create a subscription" at the top right of the member's page). The (pending) subscription configuration is automatically carried into the subscription creation form.

It is possible to automatically send a welcome email when activating a member by configuring [the "Member activated" email template](/mail_templates/member_activated).

### Active

An active member is one who has a subscription for the current or future fiscal year. A member who has a defined depot for grocery orders is also considered active.

As soon as the current subscription is ended or deleted, the member becomes inactive.

### Support

A support member is one without any subscriptions who has an annual fee set (for associations) or who owns share capital (for cooperatives). If a subscription is created for a support member, they become active.

To move an inactive member to support, simply set an annual fee amount in the member's profile (edit page). The annual fee can be set to 0 for members who should have the support status without paying any fee.

Using the "Make inactive" button at the top right of the member's page, it is possible to make a support member inactive, which will remove their annual fee or set their required share capital to zero.

Using the "Put on waiting list" button at the top right of the member's page, you can put a support member back on the waiting list. Their annual fee or number of share capital remains unchanged.

### Inactive

An inactive member is one who does not have a subscription for the current or future fiscal year and does not have an annual fee set or have share capital. An inactive member can be put on the waiting list again or moved to support.

To move an inactive member to support, edit the member's profile and set an annual fee amount (even 0 for non-paying support members).

Using the "Put on waiting list" button at the top right of the member's page, you can put an inactive member on the waiting list. Their annual fee will then be reset to the organization's default value.
