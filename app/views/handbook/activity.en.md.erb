# Member Participation

This feature allows you to manage activities and member participation in them. These participations can be optional or mandatory and can be billed or not.

## Configuration {#configuration}

Once this additional feature is activated in [your settings](/settings#organization_features_input), several settings allow you to [configure](/settings#activity) how activities and participations work.

### Activity Designation

The designation chosen in [the settings](/settings#activity) determines the terminology used and influences how activities work:

- **Work hours**: Each activity must be exactly 1 hour long. The number of participations corresponds to the number of hours worked.

  > ⚠️ This designation significantly increases administrative work. An 8-hour day requires creating 8 separate activities, each needing to be individually signed up for by the member and validated separately by an admin. For this reason, the "½ work days" designation is generally recommended.

- **½ work days**: Recommended for most organizations. Allows grouping work into half-day sessions (morning/afternoon), thus reducing the number of activities to manage.
- **Work days**: For organizations counting participations in full days.
- **Basket preparations**: For organizations where members participate in basket preparation.

### Registration Form and Renewal

The default number of participations requested will depend on the number configured for the basket size and the membership complements.

However, it is possible to let members choose the number of participations they want during their registration or [renewal](/handbook/membership_renewal). To do this, simply configure a minimum number (allowing the member to reduce the number requested) and/or a maximum number (allowing the member to increase the number requested) of participations.

> If a participation price is defined, the difference between the default number and the chosen number will be automatically added to or subtracted from the total membership amount (fields "Membership price adjustment").

### Logic for Calculating Requested Participations

The configuration of the number of requested participations is always understood for a complete fiscal year; by default, the final number requested will be calculated pro-rata based on the number of deliveries in the membership.

This logic can be modified using [Liquid syntax](https://shopify.github.io/liquid) in the "Logic for calculating requested participations" field in [the settings](/settings#activity).

### Signing Up for Activities

Members can sign up for activities from their member account, even if they don't have an active membership. This allows inactive members to participate in activities on a voluntary basis without commitment. They can also see the activities they are signed up for, as well as the participations they have completed and their validations.

When signing up, the member can specify the number of participants (each participant counting as one participation), add a note, and choose to share their phone number and departure location for carpooling. This allows a member to register multiple people at once (e.g., family members or friends coming to help). Their contact information will then be shared with other members signed up for the same activity in [the reminder email sent 3 days before the activity](/mail_templates/activity_participation_reminder). This 3-day delay is fixed and cannot be configured.

A sign-up deadline (in days) before the activity date can be defined in [the settings](/settings#activity) to avoid last-minute registrations.

A cancellation deadline (in days) can also be defined in [the settings](/settings#activity). After this deadline, members will no longer be able to cancel their registration.

## Activities {#activities}

You can create activities from [the activities list](/activities) by clicking on "New activity". As with deliveries, you can easily create activities in bulk using the "Multiple dates" tab in [the creation form](/activities/new).

> If you often offer similar activities at the same location, consider creating ["activity presets"](/activity_presets) to save time.

### Hidden Activities

Activities can be marked as "not visible" in the activity form. Hidden activities will not appear in the member's sign-up calendar, but admins can still manually assign members to them. When a member is assigned to a hidden activity, it will appear normally in their list of coming and past participations.

This is useful for activities that are invitation-only or reserved for specific members.

## Participations {#participations}

Activity sign-ups made by members are visible from [the participations list](/activity_participations). Admins can also manually sign up members or modify/delete existing participations.

Participations in activities (of the same day or past) can be validated or rejected by admins. Members will then receive an email [of confirmation](/mail_templates/activity_participation_validated) or [of rejection](/mail_templates/activity_participation_rejected) of their participation.

- **Validate**: The member showed up and completed the activity. The participation counts towards their required total.
- **Reject**: The member did not show up or left early. The participation does not count, and the activity slot becomes available again for other members to sign up.

## Billing {#billing}

If a price is defined for a participation, you can simply bill all missing participations from [the participations list](/activity_participations). Each billed participation will automatically be considered as a validated participation.

More information on [billing participations](/handbook/billing#activity) is available in the manual page dedicated to billing.
