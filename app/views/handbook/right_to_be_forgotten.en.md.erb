# Right to be Forgotten

CSA Admin provides a two-phase deletion process for members, compliant with the [GDPR](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection_en) (EU) and the [nFADP](https://www.kmu.admin.ch/kmu/en/home/facts-and-trends/digitization/data-protection/new-federal-act-on-data-protection-nfadp.html) (Switzerland). This ensures that members can exercise their right to be forgotten while preserving legally required financial records.

## How It Works {#how-it-works}

The deletion process has two distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Discard (Immediate)

When a member is discarded (soft-deleted):

- **Access is revoked immediately** – the member can no longer log in
- **Emails are blocked** – no transactional emails are sent to the member
- **The member disappears from lists** – they no longer appear in admin member lists
- **Data is preserved** – all data remains intact during a 30-day safety window

During this 30-day window, a member can be restored if needed by [contacting me via the support form](/support).

### Phase 2: Anonymization (After 30 Days)

After 30 days, personal data is automatically and irreversibly anonymized:

**Data that is removed:**

- Name (replaced with "DELETED")
- Contact and address details
- Billing and payment details
- Notes and internal remarks
- Profile and marketing details
- Newsletter delivery history
- Admin comments on member records
- Audit logs

**Data that is preserved:**

- Invoices and their PDF attachments (required for tax/accounting purposes)
- Payment records
- Membership history (for statistical purposes)
- Activity participations (with personal notes removed)
- Absences (with notes removed)

## Eligibility Requirements {#eligibility-requirements}

A member can only be deleted if they are:

- **Inactive** – no current or future subscription
- **No open invoices** – all invoices must be closed or canceled
- **No billable memberships** – no outstanding membership fees
- **No pending shop orders** – all orders must be completed or canceled

If these conditions are not met, the delete button will be disabled in the admin interface. On the member side, specific reasons preventing deletion are displayed.

## Admin Deletion {#admin-deletion}

To delete a member as an administrator:

1. Navigate to the inactive member's page
2. Click the "Delete" button in the top-right corner
3. Review the confirmation dialog explaining what will happen
4. Confirm the deletion

The member will be immediately discarded and automatically anonymized after 30 days.

> If you need to restore a discarded member before the 30-day anonymization, [contact me via the support form](/support). Restoration is only possible before anonymization occurs.

## Member Self-Deletion {#member-self-deletion}

Members can request their own account deletion from their account page:

1. Member navigates to Account → Delete Account
2. Member requests a confirmation code (sent by email)
3. Member enters the 6-digit code to confirm deletion
4. Member is logged out and sees a goodbye message

The same two-phase process applies: immediate access revocation, then anonymization after 30 days.

## Important Notes {#important-notes}

- **Anonymization is irreversible** – once the 30-day period has passed, personal data cannot be recovered
- **Invoices are retained** – Swiss and European law require keeping invoices for up to 10 years for tax purposes
- **Historical statistics remain valid** – anonymized members are still counted in membership and delivery statistics
- **Export safety** – exports (CSV, XLSX, PDF) do not reveal member IDs for anonymized members
