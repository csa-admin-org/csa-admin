# New member fee

This feature allows you to automatically bill a new member fee, for example for reusable baskets/bags, to your new members.

Once this additional feature is activated, the description and amount of your new member fee must be defined in [your settings](/settings#new_member_fee).

> If you were already billing new member fees manually (using "Other" invoices), please [contact me](/support) so that I can take care of migrating them, to avoid unnecessarily billing these fees twice to your members.

### Billing

The system takes care of billing these fees to each new member on the automatic billing day defined in [your settings](/settings#billing). If you have trial baskets, these fees will only be billed at the end of the trial period, if the member decides to continue.

It's possible to add specific text in the ["New invoice" email template](/mail_templates/invoice_created) using [Liquid syntax](https://shopify.github.io/liquid) as follows:

~~~ liquid
{% case invoice.entity_type %}
{% when 'NewMemberFee' %}
  <p>Here is your new invoice for your new member fee; all details can be found in the attached PDF.</p>
{% else %}
  <p>Here is your new invoice; all details can be found in the attached PDF.</p>
{% endcase %}
~~~
