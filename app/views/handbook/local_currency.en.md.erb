# Local Currency

CSA Admin allows supporting a local currency in addition to the national currency. Once configured in [your settings](/settings#local_currency), you can activate its use for each member individually. This activation, reserved for administrators, requires that members contact you.

By default, only membership and annual fee invoices are issued in local currency. This behavior can be changed in [your settings](/settings#local_currency) by disabling the "Limit to membership and annual fee invoices" option, which will cause all new invoices to be issued in local currency.

> Currently, only local currencies with a 1:1 equivalence to the national currency are supported.
