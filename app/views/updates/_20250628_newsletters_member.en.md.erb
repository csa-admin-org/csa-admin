# Newsletter display in member account

Members can now view the newsletters they have received from a new page in their member account.

Only newsletters that were addressed to them are displayed. Members who have unsubscribed can still view them, and can also easily re-subscribe from this page.

Find more information about unsubscriptions and re-subscriptions in [the newsletters handbook](/handbook/newsletters#subscribe).
