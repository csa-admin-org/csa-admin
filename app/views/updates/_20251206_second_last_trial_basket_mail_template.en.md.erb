# New Automatic Email: Second to Last Trial Basket

A new [automatic email](<%= mail_template_path("membership_second_last_trial_basket") %>) is now available for organizations offering trial baskets. This email can be activated to send a message to members on the delivery day of their second to last trial basket, one delivery earlier than the existing [last trial basket email](<%= mail_template_path("membership_last_trial_basket") %>).

This allows you to give members an earlier heads-up that their trial period is ending soon, giving them more time to decide whether to continue their membership.

Like other [membership emails](/mail_templates?scope=membership), you can customize the content and choose which delivery cycles it applies to.

> Note: This email is only available for organizations with 2 or more trial baskets configured.
