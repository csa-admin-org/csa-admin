# New Support Request Form

Phone, WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, email, ... communication channels are plentiful! To facilitate and centralize support requests, [a new form](/support) has been added to the top right menu bar, as well as at the bottom of each page.

The form automatically adds the link to the current page as context, which helps resolve issues more efficiently. Don't forget to provide complete details about your problem for faster resolution. ;)

Your support requests reach me directly by email, with a push notification for "Urgent" priority requests. Responses are sent directly to the email of the admin account that created the request.

Thank you in advance for prioritizing [this form](/support) for all your future support requests.
