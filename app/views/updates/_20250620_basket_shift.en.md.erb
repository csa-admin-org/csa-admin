# Basket Shifting During Absences

It is now possible to simply move the content of absent baskets to another delivery, allowing you to compensate for your members' absences without changing the number of invoiced baskets.

This function is by default only accessible to admins. You can make it accessible to members by modifying [the absence settings](/settings#absence).

Two new [automatic email templates](/mail_templates?scope=absence) regarding absences have also been added to improve communication with members.

Find more information about this feature in [the absence handbook](/handbook/absences#basket-shift).
