# Global Search

A new global search is available! Quickly find members, memberships, invoices, payments, and more, all from one place.

Open it with the magnifying glass icon in the top right menu bar, or press <kbd class="kbd">⌘K</kbd> (Mac) / <kbd class="kbd">Ctrl+K</kbd> (Windows/Linux).

Start typing and results appear in real time. Each result shows the same icon as its menu section, so you can tell record types apart at a glance. The search covers the current and previous fiscal year; open invoices are always included regardless of date.

## Search tips

Combine a record type with a number or name to narrow results:

- **"Invoice 42"** or **"Inv 42"** to find invoice #42
- **"Inv Bob"** to find all recent invoices for member Bob
- **"Payment 100"** to find payment #100
- **"Membership 12"** to find membership #12

You can also search by name, email, city, amount, or date:

- **"Dupont"** to find the member and all related records
- **"Lausanne"** to find members in Lausanne
- **"347.90"** to find invoices or payments with that amount

Multiple words use AND logic, so **"Dupont 30"** returns only records matching both terms.
