# Calendar Feed for Members

Members can now subscribe to a calendar feed (iCal) to easily track their basket delivery dates<% if feature?("activity") %>, as well as their registrations for <%= activities_human_name %><% end %>.

A "Subscribe" button has been added to each member's deliveries page, as well as a "Calendar" link at the bottom of the navigation menu.

The [iCal format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) is compatible with most calendar applications, such as Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, etc.
