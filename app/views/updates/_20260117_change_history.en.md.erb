# Change History

The change history feature, previously only available on members (called "Audits"), is now also accessible on memberships, deliveries, and delivery cycles.

Click the clock icon (located to the left of the edit button) at the top right of each page to access the full change history. This tool allows you to easily track what information has been modified, when, and by whom.

I hope this extended visibility will make it easier to track changes over time and help you understand the evolution of your data.
