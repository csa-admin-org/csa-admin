# Delivery Sheet Changes

When preparing baskets, it's not always easy to know what changed since the last delivery, who's new, who left, who switched depot or basket size. This can lead to mistakes, especially with trial memberships ending or members changing their subscription.

To help with this, a new **changes page** is now automatically included in your delivery documents. It compares each member's basket against their previous one and lists all differences: new members, ended memberships, depot changes, basket size changes, complement changes, and absences.

You'll find these changes in three places:

- **Delivery sheet PDF**: A dedicated page after the summary, grouped by depot.
- **Delivery sheet XLSX**: An additional "Changes" worksheet.
- **Dashboard & delivery page**: A collapsible section at the bottom showing the same information.

Since detecting all changes correctly involves many parameters (delivery cycles, fiscal year boundaries, complement schedules, basket shifts, ...), it's possible that some edge cases produce unexpected results. Don't hesitate to [let me know](/support) if you notice any discrepancies. Thank you! 🤗
