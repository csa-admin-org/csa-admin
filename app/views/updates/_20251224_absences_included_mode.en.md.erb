# End-of-Year Mode for Included Absences

When members don't use all their included absences by the end of their membership, the remaining absences stay provisionally marked on the last deliveries. This can cause confusion when members show up expecting a basket that wasn't prepared.

You can now configure an **end-of-year mode** to handle this situation:

- **Provisional Absence Respected** (default): Unused absences remain as absences. Members receive a reminder and can request delivery if needed.
- **Delivery of Remaining Absences**: Unused absences are automatically delivered and billed. Members receive a reminder and can report an absence to opt out.

A [new automatic email](/mail_templates/absence_included_reminder) is sent to members with unused included absences, giving them time to take action before the first provisional absence.

Configure this feature in [the absence settings](/settings#absence) and find more information in [the absence handbook](/handbook/absence#absence-included-mode).

Merry Christmas! 🎄
