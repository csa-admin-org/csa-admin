# Displaying Basket Contents to Members

Basket contents can now be displayed to your members directly on their deliveries page. When enabled, they will see the list of products included in their next basket, based on their basket size and depot.

This can be activated and customized from [your settings](/settings#basket_content):

- **Visibility window**: Control when the content becomes visible by setting the number of hours before the delivery day.
- **Title and note**: Customize the heading and add an optional note (e.g. to mention that contents are subject to change).
- **Display quantity**: Optionally show the quantity next to each product name.

As a reminder, basket contents can also be included in your newsletters using Liquid templates. For more details, see the new [Basket Content](/handbook/basket_content) handbook page.
