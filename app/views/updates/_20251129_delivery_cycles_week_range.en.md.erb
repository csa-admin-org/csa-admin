# Delivery Cycles, Week Number Range Filtering

It is now possible to limit deliveries within a delivery cycle to a specific range of week numbers using the new "First week" and "Last week" fields.

This offers more granularity than the existing months filter, allowing you to define precise seasonal boundaries. For example, a summer season from week 18 to week 42.

These new fields can be combined with existing filters (days, months, ...) for even more precise control over your delivery cycles.

Find more information about delivery cycles in [the handbook](/handbook/deliveries#delivery-cycles).
