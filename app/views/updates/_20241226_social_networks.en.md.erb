# Social Network Links

In [your general settings](/settings), you now have the option to provide links (URLs) to your social network profiles.

These links will be displayed as icons:

- In the footer of the section dedicated to your members.
- In the footer of your emails.

Here is the list of currently supported social networks, with their corresponding icon. If you feel a social network is missing, do not hesitate to [let me know](/support).

<% SocialNetwork::URLS.keys.each do |network| %>
  - ![<%= network.to_s %>](<%= image_url("simpleicons/#{network}.png") %>){:class="icon" width="20" height="20"} <%= network.to_s.titleize %>
<% end %>
