# Registration Form Improvements

The registration form has received a round of improvements: cleaner typography, smarter controls for long option lists, a search filter for depots, automatic scroll to validation errors, a sticky section navigation bar that appears as you scroll, and word count guidance when editing form texts on the admin side.

A new [Registration Form](/handbook/registration) handbook page is also available, covering every configurable aspect of the form with practical tips.

## 👉 Review Your Form

These improvements work best with clear, concise texts. Take a few minutes to [open your registration form](<%= new_members_member_url(subdomain: Current.org.members_subdomain) %>) and go through it as a new member would (on mobile too). Then check the [handbook page](/handbook/registration) for tips on keeping texts short and effective.

Short texts and clear labels make more difference than any technical improvement. Your future members will thank you! 😁
