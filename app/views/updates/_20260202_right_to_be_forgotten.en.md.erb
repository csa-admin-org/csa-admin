# Right to be Forgotten

Members can now exercise their right to be forgotten, in compliance with GDPR and Swiss data protection laws.

A new two-phase deletion process has been implemented:

1. **Immediate discard**: When a member is deleted, their access is revoked immediately and they disappear from all lists.
2. **Automatic anonymization**: After 30 days, all personal data is automatically and irreversibly anonymized.

Members can also request their own account deletion directly from their member account, giving them more control over their personal data.

Financial records (invoices, payments) are preserved as required by law, but all personal information is removed after the anonymization period.

For more details, please see the [Right to be Forgotten](/handbook/right_to_be_forgotten) handbook page.
