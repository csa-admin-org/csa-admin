# New design for the admin section 🎨💅🌈

After more than 80 hours of meticulous work, I am proud to present the new design of the admin section.

The structure of the application remains the same, so you should be able to navigate without any issues. The changes are mainly visual with some ergonomic adjustments. I hope you will like them.

The two main changes are:

- Better support for dark mode, with the ability to switch between day and night mode directly from the navigation bar (top right, sun or moon icon).
- Better support for mobile devices, allowing easier management from a smartphone or tablet.

Given the extent of the changes, you may encounter display or functionality issues. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:info@csa-admin.org) to report any omissions or suggest improvements.
