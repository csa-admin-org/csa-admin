# Design Conventions

## Panel Icons

Panels can display an icon before their title using the `icon:` option:

```ruby
panel "Title", icon: "icon-name" do
  # ...
end
```

The icon renders at half opacity (`opacity-50`) at `size-5`,
lighter than the title so it doesn't feel heavy — it serves as a quick visual cue.

## Form Input Icons

Form fieldsets (`f.inputs`) also support the `icon:` option:

```ruby
f.inputs "Title", icon: "icon-name" do
  f.input :field
end
```

The icon renders the same way as panel icons — half opacity, `size-5`, before the
fieldset legend. **Only titled fieldsets get icons** — bare `f.inputs do` blocks
(no title string) should never receive an icon.

When a fieldset also has extra options (e.g. `data:` or string-key attributes),
place `icon:` before them:

```ruby
f.inputs "Title", icon: "icon-name", data: { controller: "..." } do
f.inputs "Title", icon: "icon-name", "data-controller" => "..." do
```

The same icon mapping tables below apply to both panels and form fieldsets —
use the same icon for the same concept everywhere.

### Icon Mapping

All icons are sourced from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev), stored as SVGs in
`app/assets/images/icons/`. Two custom exceptions are noted below.

The panel icon for a concept **must** match the nav icon when one exists.

### Custom Icons

Two icons in `app/assets/images/icons/` are **not** from Lucide:

- **`banknotes`** — Custom Heroicon (stacked bills). Lucide only has singular `banknote`.
  Used for billing/payment panels and nav.
- **`redo-off`** — Custom icon (redo arrow with slash). Hand-made for "no renewal" state.

### Adding New Icons

1. Find the icon on [Lucide](https://lucide.dev)
2. Copy the SVG from the local Lucide clone (`lucide/icons/{name}.svg`)
3. Save it in `app/assets/images/icons/{name}.svg`
4. Adjust `stroke-width` from `2` to `1.5` and remove the `class` attribute
5. Use the icon via `icon("name")` helper, `panel "Title", icon: "name"`, or `f.inputs "Title", icon: "name"`

### Style Guidelines

- **Lucide only** — all icons should come from Lucide for visual consistency
- **24px / stroke 1.5** — all SVGs use `width="24" height="24"` and `stroke-width="1.5"`
- **Match nav icons** — if a concept has a nav icon, the panel must use the same one
- **One icon per concept** — if the same concept appears in multiple places, use the same icon
- **Muted color** — panel icons are intentionally subdued; they orient, not distract
- **Size 5** — panel icons render at `size-5` (20px) matching the title's visual weight
